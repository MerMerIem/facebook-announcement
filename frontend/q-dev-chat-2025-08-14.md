i added something here only for the admin 

prod_ref
and 
discount_threshold


in the product and product+variant table 

first one is var char representing serial number or smth 
second is int wich when the quantity is pased it applies specaila discount later 

add them to the controlers please

---

I'll help you add the `prod_ref` and `discount_threshold` fields to your controllers. Let me first examine your project structure to understand the current setup.

---

Now let me examine the products controller to understand the current structure:

---

Now let me check if there are any other controllers that might need updating. Let me also look at the database structure to understand the current schema:

---

Let me check the most recent SQL file to understand the current database schema:

---

I notice this SQL file doesn't show the `prod_ref` and `discount_threshold` fields, and it's missing the `product_variants` table. Let me check a more recent SQL file:

---

This is an older schema. Let me check if there are any migration files or more recent schema files:

---

Perfect! Now I can see the current database schema. I can see that the `products` and `product_variants` tables don't have the `prod_ref` and `discount_threshold` fields yet. Based on your request, I need to add these fields to the controllers. Let me update the products controller to include these new fields.

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to the getAllProducts function query and response

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to multiple functions in the products controller

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to getProductById function

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to getProductById and searchProduct functions

---

Now I need to update the remaining parts of the controller. Let me continue with the missing updates:

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to remaining parts of the products controller

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to searchProduct function

---

Now I need to update the modifyProduct and addProduct functions to handle the new fields:

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to modifyProduct function

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to addProduct function

---

Now I need to update the product variants controller to include the new fields. Let me also add them to the variant functions:

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to addProductVariants function

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to editVariants function

---

Now I need to update the getVariants function to include the new fields in the query:

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to getVariants function query

---

Adding prod_ref and discount_threshold fields to getVariants function response

---



Perfect! I've successfully updated the products controller to include the `prod_ref` and `discount_threshold` fields. Here's a summary of what I added:

## Summary of Changes

I've added the `prod_ref` (VARCHAR) and `discount_threshold` (INT) fields to the following functions in the products controller:

### 1. **getAllProducts** function:
- Added fields to the SELECT query
- Added fields to the response object

### 2. **getProductById** function:
- Added fields to the SELECT query
- Added fields to the response object

### 3. **searchProduct** function:
- Added fields to the SELECT query and GROUP BY clause
- Added fields to the response object

### 4. **modifyProduct** function:
- Added fields to the request body destructuring
- Added fields to the UPDATE query

### 5. **addProduct** function:
- Added fields to the request body destructuring
- Added fields to the INSERT query columns and values

### 6. **addProductVariants** function:
- Added fields to the INSERT query for variants

### 7. **editVariants** function:
- Added fields to the UPDATE query for variants

### 8. **getVariants** function:
- Added fields to the SELECT query
- Added fields to the response object under specifications

## Field Details:
- **`prod_ref`**: VARCHAR field for storing product reference/serial number (admin only)
- **`discount_threshold`**: INT field for quantity threshold that triggers special discount (admin only)

The fields are now available in both the `products` and `product_variants` tables through the controller functions. They will be returned in API responses and can be updated through the modify/add functions.
